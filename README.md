# Astro Log

Ever wondered what your friends have been observing last night? Or whether you've observed that particular galaxy before? **Astro Log** is a mobile app for logging and sharing your astronomical observations. Side note: No, this is *not* an astrology platform!

## Features

Log your observations including information such as 
* date and time (assigned automatically or manually),
* place of observation (via GPS or manual entry),
* observed objects (most importantly),
* observers,
* equipment used (e.g. telescopes, eyepieces, filters, mounts and binoculars),
* magnification,
* weather conditions (e.g. astronomical seeing, cloud cover on the okta scale and wind speed on the Beaufort scale),
* light pollution (using the Bortle scale, limiting magnitude or magnitudes per square arcsecond),
* images you've taken,
* and any annotations you might want to add.

Join a group and share your observational data! ðŸ”­
